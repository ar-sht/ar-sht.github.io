            <h1><em>My Story</em></h1>
            <h3>I was on vacation with a few of my parents' college friends, and one, Kyle, challenged me to create
                a website that would advise him on which rewards credit card to get. I took him on, and after much more
                pain and Django than anticipated, I pooped this sucker out! I hope you've enjoyed taking the quiz
                and that you're satisfied with your results! If not, feel free to email me below:</h3>
